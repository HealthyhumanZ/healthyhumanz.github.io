**Project Charter: Cold Thermogenesis Impact on HRV Testing**

**Project Title:** Investigating the Effect of Cold Thermogenesis on Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive study to understand the impact of cold thermogenesis on heart rate variability (HRV). Cold thermogenesis involves exposing the body to cold temperatures, which has been suggested to have various physiological benefits, including potential effects on the autonomic nervous system and HRV. By testing this hypothesis, we seek to contribute valuable insights to the fields of cold exposure, human physiology, and overall health.

**Project Objectives:**

1. **Research:** To review existing literature on cold thermogenesis, HRV, and related physiological responses.
   
2. **Data Collection:** To collect HRV data from participants before and after controlled cold exposure sessions.

3. **Analysis:** To analyze HRV data to identify any significant changes or trends associated with cold thermogenesis.

4. **Findings and Conclusions:** To draw conclusions based on the analysis and provide insights into the potential impact of cold thermogenesis on HRV.

5. **Recommendations:** To make evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of cold thermogenesis as a potential tool for improving HRV or overall health.

**Project Scope:**

- The project will involve conducting cold exposure sessions under controlled conditions.
  
- HRV data will be collected using appropriate monitoring equipment and software.

- Participants will be screened for health conditions that might impact HRV, and safety protocols will be in place throughout the study.

- Data analysis will focus on HRV metrics and changes before and after cold exposure.
