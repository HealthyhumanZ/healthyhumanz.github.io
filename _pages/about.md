I am a biopharmaceutical scientist interested primarily in areas of research related to diet and exercise. I maintain the HealthyHumanZ blog, which tracks my journey to achieve escape velocity while also sharing my lessons-learned along the way. I also do product reviews and organize these to help consumers find health-related appliances and wearables that will work best for their needs.
